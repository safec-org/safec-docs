// Was 64 -- too low for a reactor thread under real concurrent load: once
// more than TASK_MAX connections are simultaneously in flight on one
// TaskScheduler, spawn_task() returns -1 and the caller (see
// std/http/http.sc's http_accept_task_) closes the freshly-accepted fd
// before reading its pending request bytes, which the kernel turns into
// a TCP RST to the client. Verified: `ab -c 128` against a single
// http_serve_reactor thread reliably reproduced exactly this ("Connection
// reset by peer" partway through the run); `ab -c 100` (under the old 64)
// did not. 1024 gives real headroom above realistic load-test/production
// concurrency; each Task is small (a few pointers/ints), so the resulting
// per-scheduler array is trivial (~tens of KB, not the old few KB, but
// still nothing).
