// SafeC Standard Library — GPU tensor ops via Metal (Apple Silicon/macOS).
//
// The "unified memory" piece of the ML story (MLX's actual selling point):
// a Metal buffer created with the default storage mode is CPU+GPU shared
// memory on Apple Silicon — no explicit host<->device copy step the way
// CUDA/ROCm need (see gpu_cuda.h/gpu_rocm.h's discrete-memory model) —
// 'contents' on an MTLBuffer just IS a pointer the CPU can read straight
// out of after the GPU finishes writing it.
//
// Same "no real Objective-C support in safec" situation as
// std/gui/gui_cocoa.sc — every call here goes through the plain-C
// Objective-C runtime (objc_msgSend et al.) and the Metal framework's own
// C entry point (MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice). See that file's header
// comment for the full technique (typedef fn-cast objc_msgSend per
// message shape). Only linkable/runnable on macOS with a Metal-capable
// GPU (every Apple Silicon Mac, and most Intel Macs from the last
// decade) — link with '-framework Metal -framework Foundation'.
//
// Gated behind the 'mps' feature (see Package.toml's [features] — same
// convention as every other backend-specific piece of std/ this session
// added): only compile/link this on a build that opted in, since a
// non-Apple target obviously can't provide these frameworks.

// step of the pipeline setup fails (compile error in the embedded MSL
// source, no GPU present, etc.) — 'out' is left untouched on failure.
//
// Verified working end-to-end on real Apple Silicon hardware (correct
// output for a real GPU dispatch). Previously segfaulted at the
// dispatchThreadgroups:threadsPerThreadgroup: call specifically — root
// cause was a genuine SafeC compiler codegen bug (fixed in CodeGen.cpp's
// genCall), not anything specific to this file: any indirect call passing
// two or more consecutive struct-by-value arguments over 16 bytes (and not
// a Homogeneous Floating-point Aggregate) through a function-pointer cast
// hit it, because this compiler represented such arguments as raw LLVM
// aggregate values instead of the AAPCS64-correct "caller copies to a
// stack temporary, passes a plain pointer" form — self-consistent for
// SafeC-to-SafeC calls (which is why that never showed up before), but not
// what a real, externally-compiled function like objc_msgSend's target IMP

// actual compute time.
//

//                                      // after even though the CPU
//                                      // hasn't waited yet

// unflushed batch* silently reads whatever was in that CPU memory before
// the batch started (found and fixed via direct testing, not something
// caught by inspection: a naive matmul -> relu chain like this computed
// 0 instead of the real value). Use mps_matmul_f32_chained/
